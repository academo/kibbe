## Running it on MacOs

The recommended way to install kibbe in macos is via pip. If you use pip please ignore this.

Kibbe is originally developed in Linux, also build and fully compatible with Mac but the release files are not signed with an apple certificate as they [cost up to 100 dollars](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/).

Due to this, mac will block kibbe from running and you need to grant running permissions to kibbe when you run it for the first time.

You can do this by going to `Preferences -> Security -> General` where you'll see the option to `allow anyway`. Once you allow it to run you can start using it.

Note: It is likely you wil have to do this again for future updates.
